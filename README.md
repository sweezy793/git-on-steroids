# git-on-steroids
A CLI which allows you to directly easily initialise your repo, create local, create .gitignore and select files and push it to remote repo.

## How to install


* Make sure node and npm is installed
* `git clone` or download zip
* Inside directory, `npm install` to install dependencies
* `npm link` with admin privileges to make it into a system app
* `giteroid` to run CLI

## Bugs

Remoted repo and .gitignore gets created but app stops responding halfway. Maybe some octokit related error. 

## Status

Right now abandoned, because I couldn't find any solution. If you want, feel free to contribute and get this CLI back on track :)
